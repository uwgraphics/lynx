# This is a sample file for a robot set.  The name of this robot set would be `sample_robot_set' given the filename.
# A robot set is exactly what it sounds like: at least one and possibly several robot platforms grouped together.
# The format for this file can be seen in this sample:

# The `robots_by_filenames' list specifies robots to include in the set based on filenames.
# e.g., here, a ur5 robot is included using the `sample_config' configuration
robots_by_filenames:
   - robot_name: "ur5" 
     configuration_name: "sample_config" # if you want to just use the default configuration, just leave this blank
 
# The `robots_by_manual_inputs' list allows the user to specify robots manually using the same inputs as robot configuration files.
# This is useful for situations where several robots have to be placed in configurations that are
# specific just to the group structure
